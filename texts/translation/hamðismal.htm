<p><br></p>
<p>1. Great the evils | once that grew,</p>
<p>With the dawning sad | of the sorrow of elves;</p>
<p>In early mom | awake for men</p>
<p>The evils that grief | to each shall bring.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2. Not now, nor yet | of yesterday was it,</p>
<p>Long the time | that since hath lapsed,</p>
<p>So that little there is | that is half as old,</p>
<p>Since Guthrun, daughter | of Gjuki, whetted</p>
<p>Her sons so young | to Svanhild&apos;s vengeance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3. &quot;The sister ye had | was Svanhild called,</p>
<p>And her did Jormunrek | trample with horses,</p>
<p>White and black | on the battle-way,</p>
<p>Gray, road-wonted, | the steeds of the Goths.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4. &quot;Little the kings | of the folk are ye like,</p>
<p>For now ye are living | alone of my race.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5. &quot;Lonely am I | as the forest aspen,</p>
<p>Of kindred bare | as the fir of its boughs,</p>
<p>My joys are all lost | as the leaves of the tree</p>
<p>When the scather of twigs | from the warm day turns.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6. Then Hamther spake forth, | the high of heart:</p>
<p>&quot;Small praise didst thou, Guthrun, | to Hogni&apos;s deed give</p>
<p>When they wakened thy Sigurth | from out of his sleep,</p>
<p>Thou didst sit on the bed | while his slayers laughed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7. &quot;Thy bed-covers white | with blood were red</p>
<p>From his wounds, and with gore | of thy husband were wet;</p>
<p>So Sigurth was slain, | by his corpse didst thou sit,</p>
<p>And of gladness didst think not: | &apos;twas Gunnar&apos;s doing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8. &quot;Thou wouldst strike at Atli | by the slaying of Erp</p>
<p>And the killing of Eitil; | thine own grief was worse;</p>
<p>So should each one wield | the wound-biting sword</p>
<p>That another it slays | but smites not himself.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9. Then did Sorli speak out, | for wise was he ever:</p>
<p>&quot;With my mother I never | a quarrel will make;</p>
<p>Full little in speaking | methinks ye both lack;</p>
<p>What askest thou, Guthrun, | that will give thee no tears?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10. &quot;For thy brothers dost weep, | and thy boys so sweet,</p>
<p>Thy kinsmen in birth | on the battlefield slain;</p>
<p>Now, Guthrun, as; well | for us both shalt thou weep,</p>
<p>We sit doomed on our steeds, | and far hence shall we die.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11. Then the fame-glad one-- | on the steps she was--</p>
<p>The slender-fingered, | spake with her son:</p>
<p>&quot;Ye shall danger have | if counsel ye heed not;</p>
<p>By two heroes alone | shall two hundred of Goths</p>
<p>Be bound or be slain | in the lofty-walled burg.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>12. From the courtyard they fared, | and fury they breathed;</p>
<p>The youths swiftly went | o&apos;er the mountain wet,</p>
<p>On their Hunnish steeds, | death&apos;s vengeance to have.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>13. On the way they found | the man so wise;</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&quot;What help from the weakling | brown may we have?&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>14. So answered them | their half-brother then:</p>
<p>&quot;So well may I | my kinsmen aid</p>
<p>As help one foot | from the other has.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>15. &quot;How may afoot | its fellow aid,</p>
<p>Or a flesh-grown hand | another help?&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>16. Then Erp spake forth, | his words were few,</p>
<p>As haughty he sat | on his horse&apos;s back:</p>
<p>&quot;To the timid &apos;tis ill | the way to tell.&quot;</p>
<p>A bastard they | the bold one called.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>17. From their sheaths they drew | their shining swords,</p>
<p>Their blades, to the giantess | joy to give;</p>
<p>By a third they lessened | the might that was theirs,</p>
<p>The fighter young | to earth they felled.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>18. Their cloaks they shook, | their swords they sheathed,</p>
<p>The high-born men | wrapped their mantles close.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>19. On their road they fared | and an ill way found,</p>
<p>And their sister&apos;s son | on a tree they saw,</p>
<p>On the wind-cold wolf-tree | west of the hall,</p>
<p>And cranes&apos;-bait crawled; | none would care to linger.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>20. In the hall was din, | the men drank deep,</p>
<p>And the horses&apos; hoofs | could no one hear,</p>
<p>Till the warrior hardy | sounded his horn</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>21. Men came and the tale | to Jormunrek told</p>
<p>How warriors helmed | without they beheld:</p>
<p>&quot;Take counsel wise, | for brave ones are come,</p>
<p>Of mighty men | thou the sister didst murder.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>22. Then Jormunrek laughed, | his hand laid on his beard,</p>
<p>His arms, for with wine | he was warlike, he called for;</p>
<p>He shook his brown locks, | on his white shield he looked,</p>
<p>And raised high the cup | of gold in his hand.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>23. &quot;Happy, methinks, | were I to behold</p>
<p>Hamther and Sorli | here in my hall;</p>
<p>The men would I bind | with strings of bows,</p>
<p>And Gjuki&apos;s heirs | on the gallows hang.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>24. In the hall was clamor, | the cups were shattered,</p>
<p>Men stood in blood | from the breasts of the Goths,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>25. Then did Hamther speak forth, | the haughty of heart:</p>
<p>&quot;Thou soughtest, Jormunrek, | us to see,</p>
<p>Sons of one mother | seeking thy dwelling;</p>
<p>Thou seest thy hands, | thy feet thou beholdest,</p>
<p>Jormunrek, flung | in the fire so hot.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>26. Then roared the king, | of the race of the gods,</p>
<p>Bold in his armor, | as roars a bear:</p>
<p>&quot;Stone ye the men | that steel will bite not,</p>
<p>Sword nor spear, | the sons of Jonak.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sorli spake:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>27. &quot;Ill didst win, brother, | when the bag thou didst open,</p>
<p>Oft from that bag | came baleful counsel;</p>
<p>Heart hast thou, Hamther, | if knowledge thou hadst!</p>
<p>A man without wisdom | is lacking in much.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hamther spake:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>28. &quot;His head were now off | if Erp were living,</p>
<p>The brother so keen | whom we killed on our road,</p>
<p>The warrior noble,-- | &apos;twas the Norns that drove me</p>
<p>The hero to slay | who in fight should be holy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>29. &quot;In fashion of wolves | it befits us not</p>
<p>Amongst ourselves to strive,</p>
<p>Like the hounds of the Norns, | that nourished were</p>
<p>In greed mid wastes so grim.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>30. &quot;We have greatly fought, | o&apos;er the Goths do we stand</p>
<p>By our blades laid low, | like eagles on branches;</p>
<p>Great our fame though we die | today or tomorrow;</p>
<p>None outlives the night | when the Norris have spoken.&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>31. Then Sorli beside | the gable sank,</p>
<p>And Hamther fell | at the back of the house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is called the old ballad of Hamther.</p>
