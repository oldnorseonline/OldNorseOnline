<h2><em>Hrafnkel's Saga</em> Translated by Heather O'Donoghue</h2>
<h4>General Editor: Suzie Murray</h4>

<h4><em>[The story of Hrafnkell is a family saga in miniature, with only one central storyline, and only one or two main characters. But the way its author tells the story and presents the characters is entirely typical of the genre.

This is a literal (but idiomatic) translation based on the text of the saga in E. V. Gordon’s Introduction to Old Norse, 2nd edn, rev. A. R. Taylor (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981).]</em></h4>

<h4>Chapter 1: The Immigrants</h4>

<p>During the reign of King Haraldr Fine-Hair, the son of Hálfdan the Black, the son of Gubröbr the hunting king, the son of Hálfdan the Generous and Food-Stingy, the son of Eysteinn Fart, the son of Óláfr the tree-cutting king of the Swedes, a man called Hallfrebr sailed to Iceland, to Breibdalr. That’s below the Fljótsdalr district. In the ship were his wife, and his son who was called Hrafnkell. He was 15 years old, promising and able. Hallfrebr built a farm. In the winter, a foreign servant woman called Arnfrúbr died, and so it’s been called Arnfrúbarstabir – Arnfrúbr’s steads – ever since.</p>

<p>In the spring, Hallfrebr moved his home north over the moor, and built a farm in a place called Geitdalr. And one night, he dreamed that a man came to him and said: ‘There you lie, Hallfrebr, and rather carelessly. Move your farm away west over Lagarfljót. That’s where you’ll do best.’ After that, he wakes up and moves his farm away over the Rang river in Tunga, to a place which has been called Hallfrebarstabir – Hallfrebr’s steads – ever since, and he lived there until old age. But he left behind a nanny-goat and a billy-goat. And the very day that Hallfrebr moved away, a landslide fell down on the house, and these two animals were killed, and so the place has been called Geitdalr – Goatdale – ever since.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 2: The Young Chieftain</h4>


<p>It was Hrafnkell’s practice to ride over the moors in the summer. At that time, Jökulsdalr was fully settled as far up as the bridges over the river.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell rode up along Fljótsdalr Moor, and saw where an uninhabited valley branched off Jökulsdalr. The valley seemed to Hrafnkell to be more habitable than the other valleys he’d seen so far. When Hrafnkell got home, he asked his father for his share of the family assets, and said that he wanted to build a farm for himself. His father gives him this, and he builds a farm for himself in the valley, and calls it Abalból – the Manor. Hrafnkell married Oddbjörg Skjöldólfsdóttir, from Laxárdalr. They had two sons. The older was called Thórir, and the younger, Ásbjörn.</p>

<p>When Hrafnkell had occupied the land at Abalból, he held great sacrificial feasts. Hrafnkell has a great temple built. Hrafnkell worshipped no god more than Freyr, and dedicated to him half of all his most valuable livestock. Hrafnkell settled the whole valley, and apportioned out land to other men, but insisted on being their overlord; he took the authority of a priest-chieftain over them. His name was therefore lengthened by the addition of Freysgobi – Freyr’s-chieftain – and he was a very unjust man, though able. He forced the men of Jökulsdalr to serve as his supporters at the Assembly, and was kind and reasonable with his own men, but harsh and inflexible with the men of Jökulsdalr, and they got no justice from him. Hrafnkell became involved in many duels, and he never paid compensation for anyone – no one got com-pensation from him, whatever he did.</p>

<p>Fljótsdalr Moor is hard to cross, very stony and muddy, but nevertheless, father and son were always riding to visit one another, because they were on good terms. Hallfrebr thought that the route was too difficult, and he sought out a way over the fells on Fljótsdalr Moor. He established a drier – though longer – route, and it’s been called Hallfrebargata – Hallfrebr’s Way – ever since. Only those people who are really familiar with Fljótsdalr Moor use this route.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 3: Freyfaxi</h4>


<p>There was a man called Bjarni, who lived at a farm called Laugarhús. That’s in Hrafnkelsdalr. He was married, and he and his wife had two sons, one called Sámr, and the other Eyvindr, promising, enterprising men. Eyvindr lived at home with his father, but Sámr was married, and lived in the northern part of the valleys in a farm called Leikskálar, and he was very wealthy. Sámr was a very ambitious man, and knew all about the law, while Eyvindr became a merchant and went over to Norway and spent a winter there. From there, he travelled abroad and went to Constantinople, and was highly favoured there by the king of the Greeks, and stayed on there for a time. </p>

<p>Hrafnkell had one animal in his possession which he considered better than any other. This was a stallion, brown-grey, with a dark stripe down its back, and he called it Freyfaxi – Freyr-mane. He dedicated half of the horse to his favourite god Freyr. He had such regard for this stallion, that he made a solemn vow, that he would kill anyone who rode it without his permission.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 4: The Shepherd</h4>

<p>There was a man called Theorbjörn. He was Bjarni’s brother, and lived at a farm called Hóll in Hrafnkelsdalr, opposite Abalból to the east. Theorbjörn was not rich, but had lots of dependants. His oldest son was called Einarr. He was tall, and capable. One spring, Theorbjörn said to Einarr that he would have to look for some employment – ‘because I’ve no need for any more work done than the workers here get through, but you’ll be well-placed to get a job, because you’re very able. It’s not lack of affection which prompts sending you away, because you are the one child of mine I rely on the most. It’s more my lack of resources, and poverty. My other children will get jobs as farm labour-ers. But you’ll have a chance of better employment than them.’</p>

<p>Einarr replies, ‘You’ve told me this too late, because by now people have taken all the best jobs, and I don’t like being stuck with the leftovers.’</p>

<p>One day, Einarr took his horse and rode to Abalból. Hrafnkell was sitting in the main room. He greets him warmly and enthusiastically. Einarr asks Hrafnkell for a job.</p>

<p>He replied, ‘Why are you asking for this so late, because I would have taken you on first? But I’ve sorted out all the positions now, except for the one job you won’t want to have.’</p>

<p>Einarr asked what it was.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell said that he hadn’t taken on anyone to look after the sheep, although he badly needed someone to do it.</p>

<p>Einarr said he didn’t mind what he did, whether it was that or something else, and he said he needed to be taken on for a full year.</p>

<p>‘I’ll make you a quick offer’, said Hrafnkell. ‘You must drive the fifty ewes back home to the shieling, and gather all the summer firewood. This work will be one year’s employment. But I will make one particular stipulation with you, as I have done with my other shepherds. Freyfaxi roams way up in the valleys along with his herd. You must keep an eye on him winter and summer. But I am warning you about one thing: I insist that you never ride him, no matter how great your need to do so, because I swore a solemn oath that I would kill anyone who rode him. He has twelve horses with him. Whichever one of them you want to have, night or day, will be available to you. Do as I say, because as the old saying goes, “Warning wards off blame.” Now take note of what I’ve said.’</p>

<p>Einarr said that he would never do such a dangerous thing as to ride the one horse which was forbidden to him, if there were several others available.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 5: Temptation</h4>


<p>Now Einarr goes home for his clothes, and moves to Abalból. Then he moved to the shieling at the head of Hrafnkelsdalr, at a place called Grjótteigssel. Things go well for Einarr all summer, so that he never lost any sheep right up until midsummer, and then nearly thirty sheep went missing one night. Einarr searches all the fields, but doesn’t find them. They were missing for nearly a week.</p>

<p>One morning, Einarr went out early, and the mist from the south, and the drizzle, had lifted. He takes a staff in his hand, and a bridle and saddle cloth. Then he sets off out over the Grjótteigr river. It flowed in front of the shieling. There on the gravel banks lay the sheep which had been at home during the night. He drove them back to the shieling, and goes to look for the missing ones. He now sees the stud horses over on the gravel banks, and thinks about getting himself one of them to ride, supposing that he’ll cover the ground faster if he rides rather than going on foot. And when he came to the horses, he went after them, and now they shied away, horses which had never drawn back from people before – all except Freyfaxi. He was as still as if he were rooted to the ground.</p>

<p>Einarr knows that the morning is wearing on, and he thinks that Hrafnkell wouldn’t find out even if he does ride the horse. Now he takes the horse and bridles it, puts the saddle cloth on the horse’s back under him, and rides up by the side of Grjótargil, and so up to the glaciers, and west along the glaciers to where the Jökull River flows from under them, and so down along the river to Reykjasel. He asked all the shepherds at the shieling if anyone had seen the sheep, but no one had. Einarr rode Freyfaxi right from early dawn until early evening. The stallion carried him quickly over a lot of ground, because it was a good horse. It occurred to Einarr that it was time to go back, and to make a start by rounding up the sheep which were at home, even though he hadn’t found the others. Then he rode east over the shoulder of land into Hrafnkelsdalr. But when he comes down to Grjótteigr, he hears the sound of bleating over by the ravine he’d ridden out along earlier. He turns towards it, and sees thirty ewes running towards him – the very ones which had been missing for a week – and he drove them home with the rest of the flock.</p>

<p>The stallion was soaked in sweat, so much so that it dripped off every hair; it was covered in mud, and absolutely exhausted. It rolled over a dozen or so times, and then begins to neigh loudly. Then it sets off at a great pace down along the paths. Einarr goes after it, and means to head off the stallion, and planned to seize it and lead it back to the herd, but it shied away so much that Einarr couldn’t get anywhere near it. The horse gallops down along the valleys and never stops until it reaches Abalból. Hrafnkell was sitting there at the table. And when the horse gets to the door, it neighed loudly. Hrafnkell told a woman who was serving at the table to go to the door, because a horse was neighing – ‘and I thought it sounded like Freyfaxi’s neighing’. She goes over to the door, and sees Freyfaxi, very filthy. She told Hrafnkell that Freyfaxi was outside the door, very dirty.</p>

<p>‘What can have made the fine fellow come home?’, said Hrafnkell. ‘This is ominous.’</p>

<p>Then he went out, and sees Freyfaxi, and said to him, ‘I’m not happy that you’ve been treated like this, my pet, but you had your wits at home to tell me about it, and it will be avenged. Go to your herd.’</p>

<p>And at once it gallops up the valleys to its stud.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 6: The Shepherd's Death</h4>

<p>Hrafnkell goes to bed that evening, and slept through the night. In the morning, he had a horse brought to him, and saddled, and he rides up to the shieling. He rides in dark clothes. He had an axe in his hand, but no other weapons. By then, Einarr had just driven the sheep into the pens. He was lying on the wall of the pens and was counting the sheep, and the women were busy milking. Einarr and the women greeted Hrafnkell. He asked how they were getting on.</p>

<p>Einarr replies, ‘I’ve had a bad time, because thirty sheep went missing for nearly a week, but they’ve been found now.’</p>

<p>He said such a thing counted for little. ‘But hasn’t a worse thing happened? It hasn’t happened as much as might have been expected, that sheep have gone missing. But didn’t you ride my Freyfaxi a bit yesterday?’</p>

<p>He said that he couldn’t deny that.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell replies, ‘Why did you ride this one horse which was forbidden you when there were plenty you were allowed to ride? I would have for-given you one fault, if I hadn’t sworn so solemnly about it, although you’ve admitted it well.’</p>

<p>And in the belief that no good comes of people who break solemn oaths, he leapt down at Einarr and struck him a death-blow.</p>

<p>After that he rides back to Abalból with no more ado, and announces what has happened. Then he sent another man to look after the sheep at the shieling. He had Einarr carried to a hillside west of the shieling, and raised a cairn by his grave. This is called Einarsvarba – Einarr’s cairn – and from the shieling, it marks mid-afternoon.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 7: The Shepherd's Father</h4>


<p>Over at Hóll, Theorbjörn hears about the death of his son Einarr. He was very distressed about it. Now he takes his horse and rides over to Abalból and demands compensation from Hrafnkell for the killing of his son.</p>

<p>He said that this wasn’t the only man he’d killed. ‘You’re well aware that I never compensate anyone, and people just have to put up with that. But I admit that this does seem to me to be one of the worst killings I’ve commit-ted. You’ve been my neighbour for a long time, and I’ve got on well with you, and it’s been mutual. No other trivial thing would have come between me and Einarr, if he hadn’t ridden the horse. But we will often regret this, if we keep on about it, and we would have less cause for regret, if we said less rather than more about it. I will show you now that I think that what I have done is worse than other acts I have committed. I will supply your farm with cattle in the summer, and meat in the autumn. I will do this for you every year for as long as you live on the farm. With my support, we’ll find places for your sons and daughters, and provide for them so that they’ll get on well. And from now on, if there’s anything you know I have in my possession, and which you need, then just say, and you’ll never need to go without it, if you need it from now on. Stay at your farm as long as you want to, and then come here, when you have had enough. I will take care of you as long as you live. We can agree on this settlement. I imagine that most people will say that the man was a dear one.’</p>

<p>‘I refuse the offer’, said Theorbjörn.</p>

<p>‘Then what do you want?’, asked Hrafnkell.</p>

<p>Then Theorbjörn replied, ‘What I want, is for us to appoint arbitrators be-tween us.’</p>

<p>Hrafnkell said, ‘Then you must be thinking that you’re my equal, and we’ll never reach a settlement on that basis.’</p>

<p>Then Theorbjörn rode away down along Hrafnkelsdalr. He came to Laugarhús, and meets Bjarni, his brother, and tells him what has happened; he asks if he will take some part in this case.</p>

<p>Bjarni said that he [Bjarni] wasn’t dealing with his equal where Hrafnkell was concerned. ‘And even though we’re pretty well off, we can’t take on Hrafnkell, and it’s a true saying, that a wise man knows his limitations. Hrafnkell has entangled many men in law suits, men of greater standing than us. I think you’ve been stupid to have refused such good terms. I’m not going to have anything to do with it.’</p>

<p>Theorbjörn then spoke many hard words to his brother, and he says that the more there is at stake, the less courage he has.</p>

<p>Now he rides away, and they part very coldly.</p>

<p>He doesn’t stop, until he comes down to Leikskálar; he knocks at the door there. Someone came to the door. Theorbjörn asks Sámr to step outside. Sámr gave his kinsman a friendly welcome, and invited him to stay. Theorbjörn responded stiffly. Sámr sees Theorbjörn’s unhappiness, and asks what has hap-pened; he told him about the killing of his son Einarr.</p>

<p>‘It’s no big news’, says Sámr, ‘that Hrafnkell has committed another killing.’</p>

<p>Theorbjörn asks if Sámr would be willing to offer him some help. ‘The case is like this: though I’m the person most closely related, nevertheless, the blow has been struck not far from you.’</p>

<p>‘Have you tried to get any compensation from Hrafnkell?’</p>

<p>Theorbjörn described exactly what had happened between Hrafnkell and him-self.</p>

<p>‘I’ve never before heard it said’, says Sámr, ‘that Hrafnkell has made to anyone an offer like the one he’s made to you. Now I’ll ride up to Abalból with you, and we’ll approach Hrafnkell on our bended knees, and find out whether he will keep to the same offer. He’ll behave well one way or an-other.’</p>

<p>‘For one thing,’ says Theorbjörn, ‘Hrafnkell won’t want to repeat the offer, and for another, I’m no more inclined to accept it now than I was when I rode away from him.’</p>

<p>Sámr says, ‘It’s a serious matter to take on Hrafnkell in a law suit.’</p>

<p>Theorbjörn says, ‘The reason why it’s impossible to get anywhere with you young men is that everything seems such a big deal in your eyes. I think that no one can have such worthless relatives as I have. In my opinion, it’s poor behaviour from men like you, who regard themselves as experts in the law, and are keen to take on trivial cases, but don’t want to take on a case like this one, which is so clear cut. You’ll be shamed on account of this, and rightly so, because you are the most ambitious of our family. I can see now the turn things are taking.’</p>

<p>Sámr answers, ‘How will you be better off than you were before, if I take on this case and we are both humiliated?’</p>

<p>Theorbjörn answers, ‘But it will be a great comfort to me if you take on this case, come of it what may.’</p>

<p>Sámr answers, ‘I’m not keen to go into this. I’m really only doing it be-cause you’re a relative of mine. But I’m telling you, that I reckon I’m helping a fool, in helping you.’</p>

<p>Then Sámr stretched out his hand, and took over the case from Theorbjörn. Sámr has a horse brought and he rides up along the valley and rides to a farm, and announces the killing – he gets men together – and accuses Hrafnkell. Hrafnkell hears this, and thought it was risible that Sámr had taken up a law suit against him.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 8: The Lawyer</h4>


<p>Now winter passed. But in spring, when the days for summoning people to appear in court came up, Sámr rides from home up to Ab alból and sum-monses Hrafnkell for the killing of Einarr. After that, Sámr rides down along the valleys and called up neighbours to ride to the Assembly with him, and then keeps quiet, until men are getting ready for the journey to the Assem-bly. Hrafnkell sent men down through the valleys and called people up. He gathers seventy men from his assembly district. With this company he rides east over Fljótsdalr Moor and so round the head of the lake and over the ridge to Skribudalr and up along Skribudalr and south to xarheiØ br as far as Berufjörbr and [from there] the usual route to the Assembly. South from Fljótsdalr, it takes seventeen days to ride to eingvöllr – the Assembly plain.</p>

<p>But after he had ridden away out of the area, Sámr gathers men together. Most of those he gets to ride with him are men of no fixed abode, and those whom he had called up. Sámr goes and gets weapons and clothes and provi-sions for these men. Sámr leaves the valleys by another route. He goes north to the bridges, and crosses over and travels from there over Möbrudalr Moor, and they spent the night in Möbrudalr. From there they rode to Herbibreibstunga, and so over Bláfjöll and on to Króksdalr, and on south to Sandr, and they came down to Sandafell, and from there to eingvöllr, and Hrafnkell hadn’t got there. He had a slower journey, because he took a longer route.</p>

<p>Sámr sets up a tented booth for his men nowhere near where the men from the Eastern Fjords usually camp, and a little later Hrafnkell came to the Assembly. He sets up his booth in the usual place, and heard that Sámr was at the Assembly. He thought it was a joke.</p>

<p>This Assembly was extremely crowded. Most of the chieftains who were in Iceland were there. Sámr goes to meet all the chieftains, and asked them to help and support him, but they all responded in the same way: no one owed Sámr to such an extent that they were willing to take on Hrafnkell the chieftain, and thereby risk their standing; they also point out that it has always turned out the same way for anyone who has had dealings with Hrafnkell: that he has routed everyone who has taken out a law suit against him. </p>

<p>Sámr goes home to his booth, and he and Theorbjörn were miserable, fearing that their case would collapse, and that they would get nothing from it except humiliation and dishonour. And the two men are so depressed, that they can neither sleep nor eat, because all the chieftains had shied away from offering them support, even those whom they had expected to help.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 9: The Benefactor</h4>

<p>Early in the morning, old Theorbjörn wakes up. He wakes Sámr, and told him to get up. ‘I can’t sleep.’</p>

<p>Sámr gets up and puts on his clothes. They go out, down to the xØ River, below the bridge. They wash themselves there.</p>

<p>Theorbjörn said to Sámr, ‘It’s my advice, that you have our horses rounded up, and that we get ready to go home. It’s now evident, that we’ll get nothing but dishonour.’</p>

<p>Sámr says, ‘That’s all very well – but you insisted on taking on Hrafnkell, and refused to accept terms which many people with a close relative to see to would have accepted eagerly. You cast aspersions about cowardice at me and at all those who didn’t want to get involved in the case with you. I will now never give in until it seems to me to be out of the question that I’ll get somewhere.’</p>

<p>Then Theorbjörn is so moved that he weeps.</p>

<p>They see on the west side of the river, a little down from where they were sitting, that five men were walking together out of a booth. The one in front was a tall man, not heavily built, dressed in a leaf-green tunic, with a deco-rated sword in his hand; he was a regular-featured, fresh-complexioned man, distinguished in appearance, with a fine head of chestnut-coloured hair. He was easily recognizable, because he had a light-coloured streak in his hair on the left side.</p>

<p>Sámr said, ‘Let’s get up and go west over the river to meet these men. ’ Now they go down along the river, and the man in front greets them, and asks them who they were.</p>

<p>They introduced themselves.</p>

<p>Sámr asked the man for his name, and he said he was called Thorkell Thjóstarsson.</p>

<p>Sámr asked where he came from, and where he lived. He said that he was born and bred in the Western Fjords, and that he lived in Thorskafjörbr.</p>

<p>Sámr said, ‘Are you a chieftain?’</p>

<p>He said far from it.</p>

<p>‘Are you a farmer?’, said Sámr.</p>

<p>He said he wasn’t.</p>

<p>Sámr said, ‘What sort of person are you?’</p>

<p>He says, ‘I’m of no fixed abode. I came back to Iceland the winter before last. I’ve been abroad for seven years, and been out to Constantinople, and I’m one of the personal retainers of the emperor of Constantinople. But at present I’m staying with my brother, whose name is Thorgeirr.’</p>

<p>‘Is he a chieftain?’, says Sámr.</p>

<p>Thorkell replies, ‘He certainly is – in Thorskafjörbr and beyond in the Western Fjords.’</p>

<p>‘Is he here at the Assembly?’, says Sámr.</p>

<p>‘He certainly is.’</p>

<p>‘How many men has he got?’</p>

<p>‘He has seventy men with him,’ says Thorkell.</p>

<p>‘Are there more brothers?’, says Sámr.</p>

<p>‘A third’, says Thorkell.</p>

<p>‘Who is he?’, says Sámr.</p>

<p>‘He’s called Thormóbr,’ says Thorkell, ‘and he lives in Garbar in Alptanes. He is married to Thórdís, the daughter of Thorólfr Skalla-Grímsson, from Borg.’</p>

<p>‘Will you give us any support?’, says Sámr.</p>

<p>‘What do you need?’, says Thorkell.</p>

<p>‘The support and power of chieftains,’ says Sámr, ‘because we have a case against Hrafnkell the chieftain for the killing of Einarr eorbjarnarson, and we can rely perfectly well on our presentation of the case, if you back us.’</p>

<p>Thorkell replies, ‘It’s as I’ve said – I’m not a chieftain.’</p>

<p>‘Why have you been passed over, given that you’re a chieftain’s son like your other brothers?’</p>

<p>Thorkell said, ‘I didn’t say that I never had it; I passed it on, my authority, to my brother Thorgeirr, before I went abroad. I haven’t taken it back since, because I think it’s in good hands as long as he has charge of it. Go to see him. Ask him for help. He is a high-minded person, a fine man, and accom-plished in all respects; and he’s young and ambitious. Men like him are the most likely to give you help.’</p>

<p>Sámr says, ‘We won’t get anything from him, unless you involve yourself in our pleading with him.’</p>

<p>Thorkell says, ‘I promise to be more on your side than against you in this, because it’s my feeling that taking out a law suit on behalf of a near relative is a necessary enough thing. Go now over to the booth, and go into the booth. People are asleep. You’ll see where two leather sleeping bags are laid out across the inside of the booth; I got up from one, and my brother Thorgeirr is lying in the other. He’s had a huge boil on his foot ever since he came to the Assembly, and he hasn’t slept much at night. But last night the boil burst, and the core of the boil has come out. And he has now fallen asleep after that, and he has stretched the foot out from under the bedclothes and up against the end of the bed because of the inflammation in the foot. The old man should enter first, and go right into the booth. He looks to me as if he’s very much weakened by both bad sight and old age. And when you, my man,’ says Thorkell, ‘come up to the sleeping bag, you must stumble heavily and fall against the footboard, and grab hold of the toe which is bandaged up, and jerk it towards you, and see how he reacts.’</p>

<p>Sámr said, ‘You must be well disposed to us, but this doesn ’t seem like good advice to me.’</p>

<p>Thorkell replies, ‘You only have two choices: to take my advice, or not ask me for it.’</p>

<p>Sámr spoke, saying, ‘It will be done as he has advised.’</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 10: The Brothers</h4>

<p>Thorkell said he would come later – ‘because I have to wait for my men’. And now Sámr and Theorbjörn set off, and come into the booth. Everyone was asleep. They soon see where Thorgeirr was lying. Old Theorbjörn went first, and stumbled badly as he went. And when he got to the sleeping bag, then he fell against the footboard, and grabs at the toe which had been hurting, and jerks it towards him. And Thorgeirr wakes up at this, and leapt up out of the sleeping bag, and asked who was moving around so clumsily as to step on people’s toes which were already hurt.</p>

<p>And Sámr and his companion had nothing to say.</p>

<p>Then Thorkell darted into the booth, and said to his brother Thorgeirr, ‘Don’t be hasty or cross about this, kinsman, because no harm will come to you. Many people behave worse than they mean to, and it happens to lots of people, when they have a lot on their minds, that they can’t watch out for everything at once. And it’s your excuse, kinsman, that your foot hurts, and it has caused you a lot of pain. You have felt this more than anyone. Now it might also be the case, that an old man is no less pained by the death of his son, and he can’t get any compensation, and he himself lacks the necessary. He’ll feel this himself more than anyone, and it’s to be expected, that a man who has a lot on his mind can’t watch out for everything.’</p>

<p>Thorgeirr says, ‘I didn’t think he could blame me for this, because I didn’t kill his son, and so he shouldn’t be taking this out on me.’</p>

<p>‘He didn’t mean to take it out on you’, says Thorkell; ‘he just came at you harder than he meant to and he paid for his short-sightedness, but he was expecting to get some help from you. It’s a fine thing to help a needy old man. For him it’s a necessity, and not greed, to prosecute a case on behalf of his son, and now all the chieftains are shying away from helping this man, and I think that’s very dishonourable.’</p>

<p>Thorgeirr said, ‘Who are these men bringing a charge against?’</p>

<p>Thorkell answered, ‘Hrafnkell the chieftain has killed Theorbjörn’s son for no reason. He commits one bad deed after another, and won’t pay anyone any compensation.’</p>

<p>Thorgeirr said, ‘It’s going to be the same with me as with the others: I don’t see that I’m in debt to these men to such an extent that I’m willing to take on Hrafnkell. It seems to me that the same thing happens every summer to men who take out cases against him – most of them get little credit, or none at all, when it’s over; I see the same thing happening every time. I imagine that’s why most people are unwilling to get involved, people who are not forced into it by necessity.’</p>

<p>Thorkell said, ‘It may be, that I’d be the same, if I were a chieftain – that I wouldn’t be keen to contend with Hrafnkell; but it doesn’t look like that to me, because it would seem to me actually preferable to take on someone who had driven off everyone else. In my view, it would only enhance someone’s standing – mine, or that of any other chieftain – if that person could get the better of Hrafnkell, and my standing wouldn’t be diminished, if what happened to others happened to me, because there’s no reason why I shouldn’t share the same fate. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.’</p>

<p>‘I can see’, says Thorgeirr, ‘how you feel: that you want to help these men. I will now hand over to you my chieftaincy and authority, and you can have it for as long as I have so far, and from then on we can share it equally between us, and you can help anyone you like.’</p>

<p>‘In my opinion,’ says Thorkell, ‘the longer you have charge of our chieftaincy, the better. There’s no one I’d rather entrust it to than you, because you are the most impressive of us brothers in lots of ways, and I still haven’t decided what I’m going to do with myself. And you’re well aware, brother, that I haven’t involved myself in much since I came back to Iceland. Now I can see what you think of my advice. I’ve now said as much as I want to on this occasion. Thorkell streak might just go and find somewhere where more notice is taken of his opinions.’</p>

<p>Thorgeirr says, ‘I can see the turn things are taking, brother – you’re not pleased, and I can’t bear that. We’ll support these men, whatever comes of it, if that’s what you want.’</p>

<p>Thorkell said, ‘I’m only asking for something I think ought to be granted.’ ‘What do these men think that they can do’, says Thorgeirr, ‘to bring their case to a successful conclusion?’</p>

<p>‘It’s just as I said today, that we need the support of chieftains, but I’ll take charge of the pleading.’</p>

<p>Thorgeirr said that helping him would be easy, ‘and the thing to do now, is to prepare the case as meticulously as possible. And I think that Thorkell will want you to visit him before the court convenes. As a result of your persist-ence, you’ll either get some sort of consolation, or else even more humilia-tion than you’ve had already, and misery and frustration. Go home now, and be cheerful, because if you’re taking on Hrafnkell you’re going to need to keep your spirits up. And don’t tell anyone that we’ve promised to help you.’</p>

<p>Then they went home to their booth, and they were elated. Everyone marvelled at how their mood had changed, given that they’d been so gloomy when they’d set out.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 11: Hrafnkel's Humiliation</h4>

<p>Now they stay where they are until the courts convene. Then Sámr calls up his men and goes to the Lawrock. The court was set out there. Sámr stepped boldly up to the court. He begins at once to cite his witnesses, and prosecuted his case against Hrafnkell according to the due law of the land, without any mistakes, and with impressive eloquence. Next, the Thjóstarssons arrive with a great body of supporters. Everyone from the west of Iceland joined them, and that showed what popular men the Thjóstarssons were. Sámr prosecuted his case in court, to the point at which Hrafnkell was called up to make his defence, unless there might be anyone present who was willing, according to the due process of the law, to put forward a defence on his behalf. There was loud applause for Sámr’s presentation. No one said he was willing to offer a defence on Hrafnkell’s behalf.</p>

<p>People rushed to Hrafnkell’s booth and told him what was going on.</p>

<p>He reacted at once – he summoned his men and went to the courts, thinking that he would meet with little resistance. It was his intention to make insignificant people less keen to take out cases against him. He meant to break up the court in front of Sámr, and drive him off the case. But now this wasn’t an option. There was such a large crowd of people in front of him that Hrafnkell couldn’t get anywhere near. It was hard for him to put forward his legal defence. But Sámr prosecuted his case to the full extent of the law, so that Hrafnkell ended up by being declared a full outlaw at this Assembly.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell goes at once to his booth, and has his horses brought, and rides away from the Assembly and was angry about how the case involving him had turned out, because such a thing had never happened to him before. He then rides east over Lyngdalsheid¯r, and on east to Síba, and he doesn’t stop until he’s at home in Hrafnkelsdalr, and he settles himself at Abalból, and behaved as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>But Sámr stayed on at the Assembly, and went around cock-a-hoop.</p>

<p>Many people are pleased, even though things had turned out that way, that Hrafnkell had been shamed, and now they call to mind how he has shown injustice to many people.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 12: The Next Move</h4>


<p>Sámr waits until the Assembly is over. People are then getting ready for home. He thanks the brothers for their help, and Thorgeirr, laughing, asked Sámr how he thought things had gone. He said he was pleased.</p>

<p>Thorgeirr said, ‘Do you think you’re any better off than before?’</p>

<p>Sámr said, ‘It seems to me that Hrafnkell has suffered disgrace, and this disgrace of his will be talked about for a long time, and there’s a lot of money involved.’</p>

<p>‘No man is a full outlaw until a court of confiscation has been set up, that has to happen at his own home. It must happen fourteen days after the weapontake.’ (It’s called the weapontake when everyone rides away from the Assembly.)</p>

<p>‘I reckon’, says Thorgeirr, ‘that Hrafnkell will have got home and will be expecting to sit it out at Abalból. I bet that he will maintain his authority over you. You’re probably expecting to ride home and settle down on your farm – if you can, it’ll be the best that will happen. I bet that what you’ve got out of this case is that you can call him an outlaw. But I bet that he’ll exercise the same reign of terror over most people as he has always done, except that in your case you’ll be kept down even lower.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t care about that’, says Sámr.</p>

<p>‘You’re a brave man,’ says Thorgeirr, ‘and I think that my brother Thorkell won’t want to let you down. He’ll stand by you now until things are over between you and Hrafnkell, and then you can live in peace. You must be expecting us of all people to be obliged to stand by you, given that we’ve played a big part in things up to now. We’ll now ride with you to the Eastern Fjords – is there a little-used route?’</p>

<p>Sámr replied, ‘I’m going to go back the same way I came from the east. ’ Sámr was pleased about this.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 13: Torture</h4>

<p>Thorgeirr chose his body of men, and had forty accompany him. Sámr also had forty men. The company was well equipped with weapons and horses. After that, they all follow the same route, until they reach Jökulsdalr just before dawn; they cross over the river by the bridge, and by then it was the morning when the court of confiscation was to be set up. Then Thorgeirr asks how they could get to Abalból without being noticed. Sámr said that he knew how to do this. He immediately turns off the path, and rides up on to the ridge and on along the shoulder of land between Hrafnkelsdalr and Jökulsdalr, continuing until they come out below the top of the mountain beneath which stands the farm at Abalból. Grassy clefts ran up on to the heath, and there was a steep slope down to the valley, and the farm stood down below.</p>

<p>Then Sámr dismounts, and said, ‘We’ll set our horses loose, with twenty men to mind them, and we remaining sixty men will descend on the farm, and I expect that there won’t be many people up and about.’</p>

<p>Now they did just this and the place has been called Hrossageilar – Horse-gullies – ever since. The assault on the farm was a quick one. Getting up time had been and gone. People hadn’t got up. They drove a log against the door and burst in. Hrafnkell was lying down in his bed. They take him away, and all the members of his household who were capable of using weapons. The women and children were herded into one of the outbuildings. A storehouse stood in the home meadow. Between there and the wall of the farmhouse there was a pole for hanging washing on. They lead Hrafnkell and his men to it. He made many offers on behalf of himself and his men. But when that didn’t work, he begged for the lives of his men – ‘because they haven’t done you any wrong, though it’s no dishonour if you kill me. I’m not going to beg for my life to be spared. It’s humiliation I do beg to be spared. There’s no honour for you in that.’</p>

<p>Thorkell said, ‘We’ve heard that you haven’t shown much mercy to your enemies, and it’s only right that you should have a taste of your own medi-cine today.’</p>

<p>Then they seize Hrafnkell and his men and tied their hands behind their backs. After that, they broke into the storehouse, and took ropes down from some hooks; they then take out their knives, and make holes in the men’s heels, and thread the ropes through, and throw them up over the pole, and in this way hoist the eight of them up together.</p>

<p>Then Thorgeirr said, ‘Now it’s come to this for you, Hrafnkell, and fittingly so, and you must have thought it unlikely that you would suffer such shame at the hands of any man, as you suffer now. And Thorkell – what do you want to do now: stay here beside Hrafnkell, and watch over things, or do you want to go with Sámr out of the farmyard to a protected place an arrow shot away from the farm and set up the court of confiscation on some stony hillock where there is neither arable land nor pasture?’</p>

<p>(At the time, this had to be done when the sun was due south.)</p>

<p>Thorkell said, ‘I’ll stay here beside Hrafnkell. It seems less hard work to me.’ Then Thorgeirr and Sámr set off and instituted the court of confiscation; they go back after that and took Hrafnkell and his men down, and laid them out in the meadow, and the blood had dripped down into their eyes.</p>

<p>Then Thorgeirr said to Sámr that he should do what he wanted with Hrafnkell – ‘because it looks to me as if he’d be easy to deal with now’. Sámr replies, ‘Hrafnkell, I’m giving you two options. You can be taken away from the farm, together with any men of yours that I choose, and be killed. But given that you have so many dependants to look after, I will offer you the possibility of looking after them. And if you choose your life, then you’ll have to leave Abalból with all your men, and keep only those valuables that I spare you, and that will be hardly anything, and I will take over your residence, and all your authority. Neither you nor your heirs must ever make a claim. You are forbidden to come any nearer than the west side of Fljótsdalr Moor, and now you can shake hands with me, if you are prepared to accept this deal.’</p>

<p>Hrafnkell said, ‘To many people, a quick death might seem better than such humiliations, but it will be the same for me as for many others, that I’m going to choose life, if the opportunity is offered. I’m doing this mostly for the sake of my sons, because they won’t get very far in life if I die and leave them.’</p>

<p>Then Hrafnkell is untied, and he gave Sámr the right to dictate the terms. Sámr decided how much of the money to allot to Hrafnkell, and it was really very little. Hrafnkell kept his  spear, but no other weapons. That day,</p>

<p>Hrafnkell moved himself and all his household away from Abalból.</p>

<p>Thorgeirr said to Sámr,	‘I can’t understand why you’re doing this. You’ll be the one who regrets it most, sparing his life.’</p>

<p>Sámr said what would be, would be.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 14: New Life</h4>


<p>Now Hrafnkell moved his farm east over Fljótsdalr Moor, and across Fljótsdalr to east of Lagarfljót. At the head of the lake stood a little farm called Lokhilla. Hrafnkell bought this property on credit, because he had no more ready money than what he needed to buy farming things. People talked a lot about this, how his pride had taken a fall, and many now called to mind the old saying about pride having a short life. There was a good deal of forested land, and it was extensive, but poor with regard to buildings, and because of that, he bought the land cheaply. But Hrafnkell didn’t bother much about the cost and he cleared the forested land because there was so much of it, and raised up an imposing farm which has been called Hrafnkelsstabir – Hrafnkell’s Steads – ever since. It has always been known for being a good farm. Hrafnkell lived there in straitened circumstances at first. He had good supplies from fishing. Hrafnkell set to and worked hard while the farm was being built. Hrafnkell kept calves and kids through the first winter, and he did so well that nearly everything that had been put at risk survived. One might almost have said that every animal grew two heads. That same summer, there were great catches in Lagarfljót. Such things helped people in the district to keep households going, and conditions held up well every summer.
</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 15: Freyfaxi's death</h4>

<p>Sámr set up house in A balból after Hrafnkell, and then he holds a grand feast, and invites all those who had owed allegiance to Hrafnkell. Sámr offered to be their chieftain in Hrafnkell’s place. People went along with this, but there were mixed feelings about it.</p>

<p>The Thjóstarssons advised him to be kind and generous and helpful to his own men, and a support to anyone who needed him. ‘They don’t deserve to be called men, if they don’t stand by you whenever you need them. And we give you this advice, because we want everything to go well with you, be-cause we think you are a brave person. Take care now, and watch out for yourself, because it’s not easy to be on your guard against the wicked.’</p>

<p>The Thjóstarssons had Freyfaxi and his herd sent for, and they said that they wanted see these remarkable animals there’d been such stories about. Then the horses were brought home.</p>

<p>Thorgeirr said, ‘These horses look to me as if they might be useful for farm work. It’s my advice, that they be put to useful work, for as long as they are able, until the time when old age gets to them. But in my opinion, this stallion seems no better than other stallions – in fact, worse, because so much trouble has come about because of him. The fitting thing is that whoever he belongs to should have him back.’</p>

<p>Now they lead the stallion down through the fields. Lower down, there’s a cliff by the river, with a deep pool in front of it. Now they lead the stallion out on to the cliff. The Thjóstarssons pulled a bag on to the stallion’s head; they take long sticks and drive the stallion forward, having tied a stone round its neck; in this way they killed it. That place has been called Freyfaxahamarr – Freyfaxi’s Cliff – ever since. A bit further on stand the temples which Hrafnkell had owned. Thorkell wanted to go there. He had all the idols stripped. After that, he orders the temples to be set alight, and everything to be burnt.</p>

<p>Next the visitors get ready to leave. Sámr chooses valuable gifts for both brothers, and they declare their undying friendship for each other, and part as firm friends. Now they take the direct route to the Western Fjords, and return home to Thorskafjörbr with great credit. And Sámr settled Theorbjörn down at Leikskalar. He was to farm there. And Sámr’s wife went to live with him at the farm at Abalból, and Sámr lives there for a while.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 16: Hrafnkel's New Chieftaincy</h4>


<p>Over in Fljótsdalr, in the east, Hrafnkell heard that the Thjóstarssons had killed Freyfaxi, and burnt the temple.</p>

<p>Then Hrafnkell replies, ‘I think that believing in the gods is stupid’ – and he said that he would never again believe in the gods, and he was true to his word, in that he never made any sacrifices after that.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell settled down in Hrafnkelsstabir and piled up wealth. He quickly came to be very much respected in the area. Everyone wanted to sit or stand just as he wished.</p>

<p>It was at that time, that the majority of ships came from Norway to Iceland. While Hrafnkell was there, people settled the greatest part of the land in the district. No one was able to settle freely unless Hrafnkell gave his permission.</p>

<p>And everyone had to promise their support to him. He promised them his backing. He took control of all the land east of Lagarfljót. This Assembly district soon became much more extensive and populous than the one he’d had previously. It stretched up along Skribudalr, and all the way along Lagarfljót. A change in his character had suddenly come about. He was now much more popular than before. He behaved in the same way with regard to helpfulness and generosity, but as a person he was much more popular, and easy going, and less extreme in every respect. Sámr and Hrafnkell often met one another at gatherings, and they never mentioned what had happened between them. This went on for six years.</p>

<p>Sámr was popular with his supporters, because he was easy to deal with, quiet, and good with help, and he bore in mind what the brothers had advised him. Sámr loved to show off his finery.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 17: The Traveller</h4>

<p>The story goes, that an ocean-going ship came into Reybarfjörbr, and its captain was Eyvindr Bjarnason. He had been abroad for seven years. Eyvindr had turned out to be an impressive person, and had become quite a hero. He’s quickly told what had gone on, and responded as if it didn’t concern him. He was a person who kept himself to himself.</p>

<p>And the moment Sámr hears the news, he rides to the ship. The brothers are delighted to be reunited. Sámr invites him to come west. And Eyvindr is very pleased, and tells Sámr to ride home ahead, and send horses to meet the cargo. He berths his ship and does the necessary. Sámr does as they agreed: he goes home and orders horses to be sent to meet Eyvindr. And when he has got his cargo ready, he prepares for the journey to Hrafnkelsdalr; he travels up along Reybarfjörbr. There were five of them. The sixth was Eyvindr’s servant boy. He was Icelandic by birth, and related to him. Eyvindr had rescued the boy from poverty and taken him abroad with him, and he treated him no differently from himself. What Eyvindr had done was much talked about, and it was the general opinion that he was one of the few.</p>

<p>They ride up eórisdalr Moor, and drove sixteen loaded horses before them. There were two of Sámr’s household servants, and three sailors. They were all in brightly coloured clothes, and carried beautiful shields with them. They ride across Skribudalr, and over the shoulder into Fljótsdalr, to a place called</p>

<p>Bulungarvellir, and down to Gilsreyriá. The river runs east into the lake between Hallormsstabir and Hrafnkelsstabir. They ride up along Lagarfljót below the level ground at Hrafnkelsstabir, and on round the head of the lake, and over the Jökull River at Skálava b. It was then halfway between getting-up time and breakfast time.</p>

<p>There was a woman by the lake, and she was doing her washing. She sees people travelling. The serving woman sweeps together the washing, and dashes home. She throws it down beside a pile of logs, and rushes inside.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell hadn’t yet got up, and some of his friends were lying in the hall, but the labourers had gone to work. This was during haymaking.</p>

<p>The woman started to speak the moment she entered: ‘The old saying that an ageing man gets more like an old woman is true. Any honour earned early in life diminishes if someone shamefully lets it slide, and doesn’t have the guts to take due vengeance when the time comes, and such things are great scandals when they concern someone who was brave once. Now it’s quite different with people who are brought up at home, and seem to you to be insignificant creatures compared with yourself, and when they are grown up they travel from country to country, and wherever they go they are consid-ered to be very important indeed, and then they come back home and they think that they’re grander than chieftains. Eyvindr Bjarnason rode here over the river at Skálava b with a shield so fine that it shone. Such an impressive person would be an ideal target for revenge.’</p>

<p>The woman goes on and on about it.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell gets up and answers her: ‘There might well be some truth in all this – though you’re not saying it with good intentions. It’ll be a good thing to give you a bit more work to do. Go quickly south to Vibivellir and fetch Sighvatr and Snorri, the sons of Hallsteinn. Tell them to come back to me straightaway, and to bring any men they have who are able to use weapons.’</p>

<p>He sends another servant woman over to Hrólfsstabir to fetch Thórbr and Halli, the sons of Hrólfr, and any weapon-bearing men they had there.</p>

<p>These two were fine men, and altogether impressive. Hrafnkell also sent for his servants. There were eighteen of them altogether. They were armed to the teeth, and they ride across the river, where the others had ridden previously.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 18: The Traveller's Death</h4>


<p>By this time, Eyvindr and his men had got up on to the moor. Eyvindr rides west until he reached the middle of the moor – a place called Bersagötur. It’s grassless bog-land there, and it’s like riding through pure mud, and the horses were constantly up to their knees in it, or the middle of their legs, and sometimes belly-deep; underneath it’s as hard as rock. There’s a big stretch of lava to the west, and when they reach the lava field, the boy looks back and spoke to Eyvindr: ‘People are riding after us,’ he says, ‘no fewer than eight-een. There’s a big man on horseback, dressed in dark-coloured clothes, and he looks to me like Hrafnkell the chieftain. But it’s a long time now since I’ve seen him.’</p>

<p>Eyvindr replies, ‘What’s that got to go with us? I don’t know any reason why we should be afraid of Hrafnkell out riding. I haven’t done anything to him. He must be going west to the valley because he has a meeting with friends of his.’</p>

<p>The boy replies, ‘I have a feeling that he’s aiming to meet you.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not aware’, says Eyvindr, ‘that anything has come up between himself and my brother Sámr since they reached a settlement.’</p>

<p>The boy replies, ‘What I want you to do is to ride away west to the valley. Then you’ll be safe. I know what Hrafnkell is like: he won’t do anything to us, if he can’t get his hands on you. Taking care of you is taking care of everything – then the prey won’t be in the trap, and whatever happens to us will be all right.’</p>

<p>Eyvindr said that he wasn’t going to beat a hasty retreat – ‘because I don’t know who these men are. Many people would find it ridiculous of me to run away with no good reason.’</p>

<p>Now they ride west off the rocky ground. Ahead of them lies another bog, called OxamArr. It’s very grassy. There are swampy patches, so that it’s almost impossible to get across it. It was for this reason that old Hallfrebr had made the higher path, even though it took longer.</p>

<p>Eyvindr rides west on to the bog. They soon sank deeply into it. It slowed them down considerably. The others, who were unencumbered, went much faster. Now Hrafnkell and his men make their way on to the bog. Eyvindr and his men have just ridden off it. Then they see Hrafnkell and both of his sons. They begged Eyvindr to ride away there and then. ‘We’ve crossed all the hard bits now. You can get to Abalból while the bog is between you.’</p>

<p>Eyvindr says, ‘I’m not going to run away from people I haven’t wronged.’ They ride up on to the shoulder. There are some small fells rising above the shoulder. On  the outer side of one fell, there’s  one particular grassy hillock, badly worn away. It had steep banks all round it. Eyvindr rides to the hillock.</p>

<p>He dismounts there, and waits for them.</p>

<p>Eyvindr says, ‘Now we’ll soon find out what they want.’</p>

<p>After that, they went up on top of the hillock, and they dig up some stones. Then Hrafnkell veers off the path and turns south towards the hillock. He did not say a word to Eyvindr, and at once launched an  attack. Eyvindr defended himself stoutly and bravely. Eyvindr’s  servant boy didn’t think he was  strong  enough  to  fight,  and  took  his  horse  and  rides  west  over  the shoulder to Abalból, and tells Sámr what’s going on.</p>

<p>Sámr reacted quickly and sent for men. There were twenty of them alto-gether. The group was well equipped. Sámr rides east on to the moor, to where the attack had taken place.</p>

<p>Their dealings had been concluded. Hrafnkell was riding east away from what had happened.</p>

<p>Eyvindr and all his men had been killed.</p>

<p>The first thing Sámr did was to look for any sign of life in his brother. It was well and truly done: they were all dead, five of them. Twelve of Hrafnkell’s men had also been killed, but six were riding away.</p>

<p>Sámr didn’t stop there for long – he ordered men to ride after them at once. And they do ride after them, and their horses were tired.</p>

<p>Then Sámr said, ‘We might be able to catch them, because they have tired horses, while ours are all fresh – it will be a close thing whether we catch them or not before they come down off the moor.’</p>

<p>By then, Hrafnkell had come east over OxamArr.</p>

<p>Now both groups of men ride on until Sámr reaches the edge of the moor. He could then see that Hrafnkell had ridden further down the hillside. Sámr realizes that he’s going to get away down into his own district.</p>

<p>Then he said, ‘We’ll turn back at this point, because it will be easy for Hrafnkell to get more men.’</p>

<p>Sámr turns back without more ado and comes to where Eyvindr was lying; he sets to and raises a burial mound over him and his companions. These places are called Eyvindartorfa and Eyvindarfjöll and Eyvindardalr.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 19: Sámr's Humiliation</h4>

<p>Sámr then goes home to A balból with all the cargo. And when he gets home, he summons his supporters to come to him the next morning before breakfast. He means to ride east over the moor. ‘There’s no knowing how our journey will turn out.’</p>

<p>That evening, when Sámr goes to bed, a large number of men had already arrived.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell rode home and announced the news. He has some food, and then he gathers men together, seventy in all, and rides with them west over the moor, and takes them by surprise at Abalból, seizing Sámr in his bed and taking him outside.</p>

<p>Then Hrafnkell said, ‘Your situation has taken a turn which must have seemed unlikely to you a short time ago – that your life is now in my hands. I won’t be a worse fellow to you than you were to me. I’m going to give you two options: to be killed, or else that I’ll be the one to divide things up between us.’</p>

<p>Sámr said that he’d rather save his life, but said that both options seemed harsh to him.</p>

<p>Hrafnkell said that he could expect that, ‘because it’s our turn to pay you in kind, and I would have been twice as good to you, if you’d given me reason to. You shall leave Abalból and go to Leikskalar, and farm down there. You can keep the valuables that belonged to Eyvindr. But you’ll take no other goods away from here except for those you brought with you. You can take all that away. I’ll reclaim my chieftaincy, and with it my livestock and farm-stead. I can see that there’s been a big increase in my wealth, and you’re not going to have the benefit of it. There’ll be no compensation forthcoming for your brother Eyvindr, because you prosecuted the case for that other relative of yours so fiercely, and anyway, you’ve had quite enough compensation for Einarr, your cousin, because you’ve been enjoying power and wealth for six years. In my opinion, the killing of Eyvindr and his men does not weigh more heavily than the injury done to me and my men. You sent me into exile, but I’ll content myself with letting you stay at Leikskalar, and that’ll do, as long as you can keep your pride under control. You’ll be my subordinate as long as we both live. It might also be worth bearing in mind, that you’ll come off worse, if there’s any more trouble between us.’</p>

<p>Now Sámr leaves for Leikskalar with all his household, and he stays farm-ing there.</p><br>

<h4>Chapter 20: Appeal For Help</h4>

<p>At Abalból, Hrafnkell and his  men  take over the farm. He sets  up his  son</p>

<p>Thórir at Hrafnkelsstabir. He is now chieftain over the whole district. Ábjörsn stayed with his father, because he was younger.</p>

<p>Sámr spent this winter at Leikskalar. He was silent, and kept himself to himself. Many people reckoned that he wasn’t happy about his lot.</p>

<p>And later that winter, when  the days  were getting longer, Sámr and an-other man, with three horses between them, travelled over the bridge, and from there over Möbrudalsheibr, and on over the Jökull River up in the fells, on to MAvatn  and from there over Fljótsheibr and Ljósavatnsskarb, and he didn’t stop until he arrived west in  Thorskafjörbr. He is  warmly welcomed there. Thorkell had just come back from his travels. He’d been abroad for four years. Sámr stayed there for a week, and relaxed. Then  he tells  them what had gone on  between  himself and Hrafnkell, and asks  the brothers  for help and support again, as before.</p>

<p>It was Thorgeirr who had more to say on behalf of the brothers this time; he said they lived a long way off, ‘and there’s some distance between us. We thought we’d set you up rather well before we left you, so that you could easily have held on to things. But it’s turned out just as I expected when you spared Hrafnkell’s life, that you’d be the one to regret it most. We urged you to kill Hrafnkell, but you thought you knew better. The difference in intellec-tual ability between the two of you is plain to see: he left you in peace until he was able to kill someone he thought was more impressive than you. We can’t involve ourselves in this lucklessness of yours. And we are not so eager to take on Hrafnkell that we’re willing to risk our good name all the time. But we will invite you to come here with all your family, under our protection, if you think that it would be less upsetting here than being Hrafnkell’s neighbours.’</p>

<p>Sámr says this isn’t what he wants; he says he wants to go back home and he asked them to exchange horses with him. That was done at once. The brothers wanted to give Sámr fine presents, but he wouldn’t accept anything, and accused them of being mean-spirited.</p>

<p>Sámr rode home without more ado, and lived there until he was old. He never got the better of Hrafnkell as long as he lived. And Hrafnkell stayed on his farm, and maintained his good name. He died of an illness, and his burial mound is in Hrafnkelsdalr, just beyond Abalból. Many valuables, all his war-gear, and his fine spear were placed in the burial mound with him.</p>

<p>His sons took over his authority. Thórir lived at Hrafnkelsstabir, and sÁbjörn at Abalból. The two shared the chieftaincy, and were regarded as great men.</p>

<p>And that’s the end of the story of Hrafnkell.</p>
