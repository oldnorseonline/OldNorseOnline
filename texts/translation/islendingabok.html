And when it pleased them to have it thus or to add something, I wrote it in the same fashion, without genealogies and biographies of kings, and added what become known to me later and which now is more fully declared in this one than that one. But whatever is incorrect in this scholarship, one should consider better what is proven to be truer.</p>

And that was eight hundred and seventy winters after the birth of Christ, as is written in his [Eadmund&rsquo;s] saga.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There was a Norwegian called Ing&oacute;lfr, of whom it is said truthfully that he was the first to travel from there to Iceland&mdash;when Haraldr inn h&aacute;rfagri was sixteen years old, and on another occasion a few years later. He lived to the south in Reykjav&iacute;k. Where Ing&oacute;lfr first made landfall, to the east of Min&thorn;akseyri, is called Ing&oacute;lfsh&ouml;f&eth;i, but where he established his own property, to the west of &Ouml;lfoss&aacute;, is called Ing&oacute;lfsfell.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At that time, Iceland had woods growing between the mountains and the shore. Christians were here then, whom Scandinavians [<em>Nor&eth;menn</em>] call&nbsp;<em>Papar</em>, but then they left, because they did not want to be here alongside heathen people. They left Irish books, bells and croziers, from which one can tell that they were Irishmen.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">And then began a very great migration of people here from Norway, until King Haraldr forbade it, because he thought that otherwise his land would be deserted. Then they agreed that each person who was coming here and was not excepted from it, would have to pay the king five&nbsp;<em>aurar</em>. And it is said that King Haraldr was seventy years old, and got to be eighty. Those were the beginnings of the payment which is now called&nbsp;<em>landaurar</em>, and sometimes more was paid for that and sometimes less, until &Oacute;l&aacute;fr inn digri [the stout] made it clear that each person who would travel between Norway and Iceland, except women/wives or those people whom he took with him, must pay the king half a mark. So &THORN;orkell Gellisson told me.</p>

Ketilbj&ouml;rn Ketilsson, a Norwegian, lived to the south as Mosfell inn efri, from which come the people of Mosfell [<em>Mosfellingar</em>]. Au&eth;r, daughter of the Norwegian chieftain Ketill flatnef [flat-nose], lived to the west in Brei&eth;afj&ouml;r&eth;r, from which come the people of Brei&eth;afj&ouml;r&eth;r [<em>Brei&eth;fir&eth;ingar</em>]. Helgi inn magri [the lean], a Norwegian, the son of Eyvindr austma&eth;r [Easterner], lived to the north in Eyjafj&ouml;r&eth;r, from which come the people of Eyjafj&ouml;r&eth;r [<em>Eyfir&eth;ingar</em>]. And when Iceland had become extensively settled, a Norwegian [<em>austr&aelig;nn</em>] called &Uacute;lflj&oacute;tr brought the first laws here from Norway&mdash;as Teitr told us&mdash;and they were called the&nbsp;<em>&Uacute;lflj&oacute;tsl&ouml;g</em> [laws of &Uacute;lflj&oacute;tr]. &Uacute;lflj&oacute;tr was the father of Gunnarr, from whom the people of Dj&uacute;pdalr [<em>Dj&uacute;pd&aelig;lir</em>] in Eyjafj&ouml;r&eth;r are descended. But those laws were mostly arranged in the same way as the&nbsp;<em>Gula&thorn;ingsl&ouml;g</em> [laws of the Gula&thorn;ing] or the counsel of &THORN;orleifr inn spaki [the wise] H&ouml;r&eth;a-K&aacute;rason, where something had to be expanded or learned or arranged in another way. &Uacute;lflj&oacute;tr was in the east in L&oacute;n. But it is said that Gr&iacute;mr geitsk&ouml;r [goat-hair], who on his advice explored the whole of Iceland before the&nbsp;<em>al&thorn;ingi</em> [All-Thing] was established, was his foster-brother. And each person received a penny from him to take land here, and he gave that money afterwards to temples (?).</p>

But a man who owned land in Bl&aacute;sk&oacute;gar was condemned for killing a slave or freedman. (He is known as &THORN;&oacute;rir kroppinskeggi [shrivelled beard], while his grandson is called &THORN;orvaldr kroppinskeggi. He travelled afterwards to the Austfir&eth;ir [East-Fjords] and there burned his own brother Gunnar in&mdash;so said Hallr &Oacute;r&aelig;ksjuson. But the man who was murdered was called Kolr. The gorge where the body was found, which was afterwards called Kolsgj&aacute; [Kolr&rsquo;s gorge], was named after him.) That land became general property, and the people of the land set it to the use of the&nbsp;<em>al&thorn;ingi</em>. There is therefore a common right to gather wood for the&nbsp;<em>al&thorn;ingi</em> in the woods and to pasture horses on the heaths. &Uacute;lfhe&eth;inn told us that.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Wise people have also said that after sixty years, Iceland was fully settled, so that there was no more left. Around that time, Hrafn, the son of H&aelig;ingr the settler [<em>landn&aacute;mama&eth;r</em>], took the position of law-speaker following &Uacute;lflj&oacute;tr, and held it for twenty years. He was from Rang&aacute;rhverfi. That was sixty years after the slaying of King Eadmund, a year or two before the death of Haraldr inn h&aacute;rfagri, by the reckoning of wise people. &THORN;&oacute;rarinn Ragabr&oacute;&eth;ir, the son of &Oacute;leifr hjalti [hilt], took the position of law-speaker after Hrafn and held it another twenty years. He was from Borgarfj&ouml;r&eth;r [<em>borbfirzkr</em>].</p>

Then they noted from the passage of the sun that summer was slipping back towards the spring. But no-one was able to tell them that there was one day more than a whole number of weeks in two half-years, and that was the reason.</p>

He was from Brei&eth;afj&ouml;r&eth;r, the son of Hallsteinn &THORN;&oacute;r&oacute;lfsson, a settler of Mostrarskeggi, and &Oacute;sk daugher of &THORN;orsteinn inn rau&eth;i [the red]. He dreamt that he was at the L&ouml;gberg [Law-Rock], when there was a crowd there, and that he was awake even though everyone else was asleep. And after that he dreamt that he slept, and that everyone else was awake. &Oacute;sv&iacute;fr Helgason, the grandfather of Gellir &THORN;orkelsson, interpreted that dream thus: that everyone would maintain silence when he spoke at the L&ouml;gberg, but that afterwards, when he fell silent, everyone would shout in assent of what he had said. And they were both very wise men. And thereafter, when people came to the&nbsp;<em>&thorn;ing</em>, he proposed the course at the L&ouml;gberg that every seventh summer, an extra week should be added, and to test how that was received. But just as &Oacute;sv&iacute;fr predicted from the dream, everyone then &lsquo;woke&rsquo; well to that, and it was thenceforth included in the law on the advice of &THORN;orkell m&aacute;ni and other wise men. As the correct count, there are in each year five days of the fourth&nbsp;<em>hundra&eth;</em> [i.e. 365 days] (if it is not a leap-year, in which case one more), but in our count there were four. But then every seventh year was augmented in our count by a week, XXXXX en engu at hinu, &thorn;&aacute; ver&eth;a sjau &aacute;r saman jafnl&ouml;ng at hv&aacute;rutveggja.

Oddr&rsquo;s son &THORN;orvaldr, together with H&aelig;nsa-&THORN;&oacute;rir, was involved in the burning in of &THORN;orkell Blund-Ketilsson in &Ouml;rn&oacute;lfsdalr; &THORN;&oacute;r&eth;r gellir became the chief plaintiff in the suit because Hersteinn, the son of &THORN;orkell Blund-Ketilsson, was married to &THORN;&oacute;runn, his niece. She was the daugher of Helga and Gunnar, her sister J&oacute;fr&iacute;&eth; being married to &THORN;orsteinn Egilsson. So &THORN;orvaldr and H&aelig;nsa-&THORN;&oacute;rir were sued at the thing which was held in Borgarfj&ouml;r&eth;r, in the place which afterwards was called &THORN;ingness. At that time it was the law that a suit over a killing had to be prosecuted at the&nbsp;<em>&thorn;ing</em> which was nearest to the site of the killing. But they fought there, and the&nbsp;<em>&thorn;ing</em> could not be conducted legally. &THORN;&oacute;r&oacute;lfr refr [fox] fell there, the brother of &Aacute;lfr &iacute; D&ouml;lum [in the Dales], from the retinue of &THORN;&oacute;r&eth;r gellir. And afterwards the plaintiffs went to the&nbsp;<em>al&thorn;ingi</em>, and they also fought there. Then people from Oddr&rsquo;s retinue fell, and then H&aelig;nsa-&THORN;&oacute;rir was condemned and later killed, and many of those who were involved in the burning. Then &THORN;&oacute;r&eth;r gellir recounted at the L&ouml;gberg how badly it served people to travel to an unfamiliar&nbsp;<em>&thorn;ing</em> to prosecute for a killing or to complain (?), and told what lay in his path before he could come to law through that suit, and said what kind of problem would eventuate if a better approach was not found.</p>

He sent a priest here to Iceland, &THORN;angbrandr by name, who acquainted people with Christianity and baptised everyone who accepted the faith. And Hallr &THORN;orsteinsson, from S&iacute;&eth;a, had himself baptised forthwith, as did Hjalti Skeggjason from &THORN;j&oacute;rsdalr; Gizurr inn hv&iacute;ti [the white], son of Teitr from Mosfell, son of Ketilbj&ouml;rn; and many other chieftains. However, there were also many who spoke against it and refused it. And when he had been here for or or two years, he left&mdash;he had kill two or three men here, who had ritually insulted him. And when he came east he told King &Oacute;l&aacute;fr everything which had happened to him here, and gave the impression that it was not to be expected that Christianity would take hold here yet. But the King grew very angry at that and planned to have those of our people who were there in the East maimed or killed for it. But that same summer Gizurr and Hjalti travelled out from here and convinced the king not to, and promised him that they would arrange a new attempt (?), so that Christianity might still be accepted here, and they gave the impression that they expected nothing other than to succeed there.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">So the following summer they and a priest called &THORN;orm&oacute;&eth;r travelled from the East and, with everything having gone well, arrived in the Vestmannaeyjar when ten weeks of the summer had passed. Teitr, who was himself there, said to report that thus. (The summer before it had been declared in the law that people had to come to the&nbsp;<em>al&thorn;ingi</em> when ten weeks of the summer had passed thus, when up to that time they had come a week before.) And the travellers went from there to the mainland and on to the&nbsp;<em>al&thorn;ingi</em> and heard from Hjalti that he was back in Laugardalr with twelve men because he had been condemned to three-year outlawry at the&nbsp;<em>al&thorn;ingi</em> the summer before for decrying the gods. The reason for that was that he said this couplet at the L&ouml;gberg:</p>

And before they departed, Hjalti and those who were back with him rode up to them. And thereafter they rode to the&nbsp;<em>&thorn;ing</em>, and first their kinsmen and friends came to meet them, and they had requested. But the heathen people gathered together, full armed, and it was so near to coming to a fight that no-one could see a way out.</p>

And it is said that it was amazing how well they spoke. And because of that it turned out that one person named another as a witness, and each side&mdash;the Christian and the heathen people&mdash;declared the other outside their laws, and walked then from the L&ouml;gberg. Then the Christian men asked Hall of S&iacute;&eth;a to present their laws&mdash;the ones which the Christians had to follow. But he passed on the responsibility by striking a deal with &THORN;orgeirr, that &THORN;orgeirr the law-speaker should present them, though he was still heathen then. And afterwards, when everyone returned to their huts, &THORN;orgeirr laid himself down and drew his cload over himself and stayed there all of that day and the following night and didn&rsquo;t say a word. But the next morning he got up and announced that everyone had to go to the L&ouml;gberg.</p>

He spoke about how the kings of Norway and Denmark had had dicord and wars between themselves for a long time, until the people of those countries made peace between them, even though they didn&rsquo;t want it. And the way that negotiation turned out was that at times they sent each other precious gifts, and while they lived, that peace held. &lsquo;And now it the idea suggests itself to me&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;that we also should not accept the course where people fall into the greatest opposition, and let us settle on a compromise between them, so that both have their way to an extent, and we all have one law and one set of customs. It must be true that when we break the law in two, we will will also break our peace.&rsquo; And he closed his speech, such that both sides agreed that all had to have one law&mdash;the one which he suggested (?).</p>

But the exposure of children, along with the eating of horse-meat, would remain in the ancient law. People had to make sacrifices in secret, if they wanted to avoid three-year outlawry, which would happen if there were witnesses. And a few years later, that heathen practice was also taken away, like the others.</p>

In his days there happened to be many chiefs and powerful men outlawed or driven from the land for killings or fights because of his power and government. And he breathed his last in the same year that &Oacute;l&aacute;fr inn digri [the stout] fell, who was the son of Haraldr, son of Go&eth;r&ouml;&eth;r, son of Bj&ouml;rn, son of Haraldr Fairhair, thirty years after the death of &Oacute;l&aacute;fr Tryggvasonr.</p>

And Hallr, who had both a good memory and was truthful, and remembered when he was baptised, said to us that &THORN;angbrandr baptised him when he was three winters old, and that was one winter before Christianity was taken into law here. And he set up his farm when he was thirty and dwelled sixty four winters in Hauksdalr and had ninety four winters when he breathed his last, and that was on the feast of Bishop Martin, in the tenth winter after the death of Bishop &Iacute;sleifr.</p>

One winter he was here in this country, and the other in Gautland. And then his name was changed, so that he was called Gisr&ouml;&eth;r. Thus he said to us.</p>

According to his account, are written in this book the biographies of all the law-speakers which were before our memory, and &THORN;&oacute;rarinn, his brother, and his father, Skeggi, and many wise men told him, of those biographies which were before his memory, in accordance with that which Bj&ouml;rn the wise had said, their father&rsquo;s father, who remembered &THORN;&oacute;rarin the law-speaker and six others after.</p>

Throgh his popularity and the persuasions of he and S&aelig;mundar, with the guidance [umbr&aacute;&eth;i] of Mark&uacute;s the law-speaker, it was laid down in law that all men should tally up and value all their property and swear that it was valued correctly, whether it was in lands or in movable possessions [lausaaurum], and then pay a tithe on it. That is a great token of how obedient the land&rsquo;s men were to that man, that he brought it about [er hann kom &thorn;v&iacute; fram], that all property in Iceland and the land itself was valued with promises upon oaths, and tithes made and laid down in law that it should be so as long as Iceland is settled.</p>

And he had previously counted the farms here in this country, and there were then, in all, eight hundred and forty [sjau hundru&eth;] in the East Firth&rsquo;s Quarter [Austfir&eth;ingafj&oacute;r&eth;ungi], and in the Rang&aacute; Quarter [Rang&aelig;ingafj&oacute;r&eth;ungi] twelve hundred [t&iacute;u], and in the Brei&eth;afj&ouml;r&eth;r Quarter [Brei&eth;fir&eth;ingafj&oacute;r&eth;ungi] one thousand and eighty [n&iacute;u], and in the Eyjafj&ouml;r&eth;r Quarter [Eyfir&eth;ingafj&oacute;r&eth;ungi] fourteen hundred and forty [t&oacute;lf], but those who did not have to pay assembly tax were not counted through the whole of Iceland [en &oacute;tal&eth;ir v&aacute;ru &thorn;eir, er eigi &aacute;ttu &thorn;ingfararkaupi at gegna of allt &Iacute;sland] (Gr&oslash;nlie 2006: 12).</p>

They were to be declared the following summer in the Law Council [l&ouml;gr&eacute;ttu] and all those which the majority said they did not oppose were to be kept. And it happened because of that, that manslaughter [V&iacute;gsl&oacute;&eth;i] was written into law, and many others, and declared at the Law Council by priests the following summer. And that pleased everyone, and no one spoke in opposition to it.</p>

He then sent word to his Althing friends and chieftains, that they should ask &THORN;orl&aacute;kr, son of Run&oacute;lfr, son of &THORN;orleikr, the brother of Hallr in Haukdalr, to have himself consecrated bishop. And all did that just as he asked [sv&aacute; sem or&eth; hans k&oacute;mu til], and this was obtained because Gizurr himself urged it so strongly [ok fekkst &thorn;at af &thorn;v&iacute;, at Gizurr haf&eth;i sj&aacute;lfr fyrr mj&ouml;k be&eth;it] (Gr&oslash;nlie 2006: 12).

Gregory VII was then pope. And afterwards he was in Denmark for the next winter and came to this country in the following summer. And when he had been bishop for twenty four winters, just as his father, then J&oacute;an, &Ouml;gmundr&rsquo;s son, was ordained as bishop to the first see at H&oacute;lar. He was then fifty four [vetri mi&eth;r en h&aacute;lfsext&ouml;gr]. And twelve winters later, when Gizurr had been bishop thirty six winters in all, then &THORN;orl&aacute;kr was consecrated bishop. Gizurr had him ordained to the see in Sk&aacute;laholt during his lifetime. &THORN;orl&aacute;kr was then two winters more than thirty, and Bishop Gizurr breathed his last thirty nights later in Sk&aacute;lholt on the third day of the week, the fifth day before the calends of June [&aacute; inum &thorn;ri&eth;ja degi &iacute; viku fimmta kalend.

He had then sat on the throne in Miklagar&eth;r for thirty eight years. And two winters later there was a change of lunar cycles. Then Eysteinn and Sigur&eth;r had been kings in Norway seventeen winters after Magn&uacute;s, their father, son of &Oacute;lafr, son of Haraldr. That was a hundred and twenty winters after the fall of &Oacute;lafr Tryggvasonar, and two hundred and fifty after the killing of Edmund king of England, and five hundred and sixteen winters after the death of Pope Gregory, who brought Christianity to England, according to that which has been tallied.
